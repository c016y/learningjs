//I've learned that jQuery is starting to be something of the past and I have decided to adopt the Vue.js framework instead.
//I feel for getting a job I should learn react.js at some point, however I want to focus on actually building things as quickly and
//neatly as possible. From what I've rea, Vue is the future. So today I will write something basic with Vue tonight, and start building
//something cooler hopefully.

var app = new Vue({
	el: '#box',
	data: {
		message: "Hello Vue!";
	}
});

//okay so what I have should be working.
//idk why it's not, I referenced the repo, I installed it with npm, I'm not sure what i'm missing. 
//getting late, will try again tomorrow :[
